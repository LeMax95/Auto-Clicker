# Auto-Clicker App

## Overview
The Auto-Clicker app is an automation tool that simulates human-like interactions with web pages. By performing searches, clicking on links, and navigating pages with randomized time intervals, it mimics real user behavior. The app also spoofs geographical locations by generating random coordinates, providing a more authentic browsing experience. This can be useful for increasing engagement metrics, performing SEO testing, or simulating user behavior for various purposes.

## Features
